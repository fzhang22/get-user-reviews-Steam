Core gameplay is solid, with realistic bullet dynamics, interesting looting system, intense firefights, and strategic positioning to keep yourself alive.

You constantly face decisions and fast paced combat.

3. Bugs
4. Errors
5. Unrealistic shooting accuracy, running speed, and jumping 
6. Content way to expensive $2.50 for a key this game ain't free they expected us to pay a lot see the greediness

I originally owned the game on an Xbox One X, but it was an absolute mess playing it on that. The game was locked at 30 fps and crashed constantly because it would overheat my Xbox. Also, you can imagine how difficult playing a game like PUBG is on a controller with no aim assist. Still, I had a ton of fun playing it on the Xbox and put around 150 hours into it on that. Playing on PC has been spectacular though. Playing it in 1440p at around 110 fps is a night and day difference to the Xbox. The visuals might not match some other AAA titles, but they are close. It is good to see that Bluehole is still refining the game by adding new weapons and switching up weapons like the M16, UMP, and Vector while adding the MP5K.

What else have I done?
1. Modified all video settings to the lowest (Keeping ONLY resolution to 1920*1080).
2. Created Windows Defender exclusions for SteamApps folder.
3. Created performance counters to check GPU spikes
4. Created performance counters to check CPU spikes
5. Modified the page file accordingly.
6. Tried with customized options on the launcher (Use all available CPUs and stuff)

Vikendi is impossible to play, not because people doesn't look for it, but because of an unbearable poor performance. I can't get 60 fps with the above.
You can have a game in which you get 60 ms latency, but next one will be over 150 ms until you close and re-open it (and it doesn't work every time). This is the only game in which I experience such a thing. Even in games with up to 50 ms latency, desync plays its own game.
Launching PUBG takes OVER 50 SECONDS now (It used to take 10'').
Can never play solo/duo in SA servers.
Sound ""bugs"" are now terrible.

At this stage when I play, I noticed I spend more time complaining about it than having a good time.
